<p>用最少的临床数据预测膝关节内收力矩对步态再训练的反应</p>
<p>0. Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis(膝关节炎)<-caused by high joint load<-also as knee adduction moment(KAM, 膝关节内收力矩)<-can be reduced by foot progression angle modifications. Use 6 features->predict 1st peak KAM reduction after toe-in gait retraining. Create synthetic dataset from ground-truth dataset. Gain small absolute error. Clinicians no longer need gait lab instrumentation to predict the reduction.</p>
<p>1. Introduction: By reducing lever arm(A), Toe-in/out gait is currently the most efficacious method to reduce lever arm(B), KAM trajectory, and peak KAM(C).</p>

<p>2. Methods: Collected data from dataset1 that maps different toe-in angles and KJC positions during baseline gait to different KJC offsets in both mediolateral and anterior-posterior directions with basis splines of order 12(2.1).</p>
<p>3. Exert the previous model that predict KJC offsets on a new dataset2 that only contains baseline gait trials and generate KAM reduction at different toe-in angles(2.2). Train another linear model that contains 6 features: height, weight, walking speed, static alignment, baseline FPA, toe-in FPA, to predict KAM reduction(2.3).</p>
<p>4. Test the KAM trajectory model1 provides and the corresponding KAM reduction model2 provides on dataset3 to see whether the model can generalize on data given by a different lab(2.4).</p>

<p>5. Future Work: Calculate the moment with a more accurate formula. Use toe-out gait modification data as well. Incorporate datasets from multiple labs to further generalize the model. Investigate why weight has little thing to do with KAM reduction. Make sure that all features can be obtained without gaitanalysis. Improve measurement accuracy with motion capture techniques(e.g. wearable sensing, CV).</p>
<p>6. My Question: What's the legitimacy of using linear model to predict KAM reduction? Even if we get the optimal toe-in angle, how can the patient control his/her feet to walk exactly in that angle?</p>

<p>使用定量T2松弛测量法和深度学习自动评估膝关节软骨退化的开源软件</p>
<p>0. Abstract: A fast, automated femoral cartilage segmentation model for measuring T2 relaxation values and longitudinal changes is proposed and open-sourced. Its assessments of cartilage health agreed with an expert as closely as experts agreed with one another.</p>
<p>1. Introduction: Novel quantitative magnetic resonance imaging(qMRI) techniques can detect early changes in cartilage matrix composition, enabling earlier measurement and intervention, while typical X-rays can only detect and assess visible changes. It's principle is to map multi-echo spin-echo(MESE) T2-weighted MRIs to T2 relaxation time. First of all, we need to segment cartilage in MRI scans quickly and automatically. Instead of using structural sequences and imperfect registration as previous studies did, this work aims to segment MESE images directly: MESE MRI->T2-based cartilage health and disease progression at expert level.</p>
<p>2. Methods: After receiving the MRI, a musculoskeletal radiologist will segment the cartilage, and the segmentation is ground truth. We will train a CNN model from it and test examine model's segmentation on a test set(Fig 1. yellow line). After mapping and standardizing the segmented cartilage to a plane with 12 subregions, we calculate the average T2 value and 4-year change in T2 value in each subregion under both expert's and CNN's segmentations(Fig 2.). At last, we'll compare areas of increased T2 both approaches give.

<p>3. Results: Training the model takes approximately 1 day. Evaluating with the model takes several seconds. By comparing segmentation masks using Dice score and jaccard index, the model agrees better with readers than readers agree with each other(Tab. 1). Comparison of subregional T2 mean values and longitudinal subregional T2 change are shown in Fig. 2-4. The percentage of cartilage area estimated using model segmentations agree well with expert's.</p>

<p>4. Discussion: The proposed model exceeds all previous models, and is close to the limit of reproducibility for measuring regional T2 values. The author also made the code publicly available for further comparison.</p>
