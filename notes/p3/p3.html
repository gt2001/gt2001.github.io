<p>0. Delaunay triangulation has many pretty mathematical properties.</p>
<p>1. TetGen implements 2 algorithms: the Bowyer-Watson algorithm and the incremental flip algorithm. Both have the worst-case runtime O(n^2) and the expected running time O(nlogn).</p>
<p>2. TetGen takes Piecewise Linear Complexes(PLCs, have two properties) as the input(.poly and .smesh files). It focuses on: the representation of the geometry(the boundary) and the quality of the mesh.</p>
<p>3. -p to conform to the constrained Delaunay property and improve the mesh quality.</p>
<p>4. -y to preserve the surface mesh(doesn't subdivide it).</p>
<p>5. -c to keep the convex hull of the mesh if the input surface mesh doesn't enclose of 3d volume.</p>
<p>6. PLCs have a limitation: it doesn't take the curvature of the surfaces into account.</p>
<p>7. Steiner points are necessary for triangulating some 3d polyhedra(e.g. the schonhardt polyhedron(left) and the chazelle's polyhedron(right) shown below).</p>

<p>8. There are three types of steiner tetrahedralizations: conforming Delaunay, constrained Delaunay, and constrained. The last one can preserve the input domain boundaries, thus it's useful in many engineering applications.</p>
<p>9. Mesh quality: radius-edge ratio=radius/shortest edge, at least 0.612. Dihedral angle between 0-180 is also measured by TetGen.</p>
<p>10. Mesh adaptation and mesh sizing functions can control the mesh density and thus can reduce the simulation error by refining areas that have big gradients. The function H: |X|->R maps each point to a number indicating the edge length at that point isotropically. The -a switch can exert a maximum volume bound on every tetrahedra of the mesh. H can be assigned initially with a .mtr file or by a background mesh with a value at each mesh node indicating the mesh size. Set the number to zero to let TetGen ignore the number at that point. An adaptation method is shown below.</p>

<p>11. The figure shown above is a detailed flowchart of the mesh generation process of TetGen. This(page 24) is very important!</p>
