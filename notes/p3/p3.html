<p>0. Delaunay triangulation has many pretty mathematical properties.</p>
<p>1. TetGen implements 2 algorithms: the Bowyer-Watson algorithm and the incremental flip algorithm. Both have the worst-case runtime $O(n^2)$ and the expected running time $O(nlogn)$.</p>
<p>2. TetGen takes Piecewise Linear Complexes(PLCs, have two properties) as the input(.poly and .smesh files). It focuses on: the representation of the geometry(the boundary) and the quality of the mesh.</p>
<p>3. -p to conform to the constrained Delaunay property and improve the mesh quality.</p>
<p>4. -y to preserve the surface mesh(doesn't subdivide it).</p>
<p>5. -c to keep the convex hull of the mesh if the input surface mesh doesn't enclose of 3d volume.</p>
<p>6. PLCs have a limitation: it doesn't take the curvature of the surfaces into account.</p>
<p>7. Steiner points are necessary for triangulating some 3d polyhedra(e.g. the schonhardt polyhedron and the chazelle's polyhedron).</p>
<p>8. There are three types of steiner tetrahedralizations: conforming Delaunay, constrained Delaunay, and constrained. The last one can preserve the input domain boundaries, thus it's useful in many engineering applications.</p>
<p>9. Mesh quality: radius-edge ratio=radius/shortest edge, at least $/sqrt{6}/4$. Dihedral angle between $0^/circ-180^/circ$ is also measured by TetGen.
